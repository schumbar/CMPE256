# Assignment 04: VAR Silver Gold Commodity Pricing Predict Time Series 
By Shawn Chumbar

### Assignment Description
The notebook that the professor gave to us appears to explore the forecasting of Gold and Oil prices using time series analysis techniques such as Granger's Causality Test and the Vector Auto Regressive (VAR) model. It aims to predict the future prices of Gold and Oil based on historical data of Gold prices, Silver prices, Crude Oil prices, Stock indices, Interest Rates, and USD rates.

### What I've Learned
The notebook aims to explore the relationships between multiple economic variables and use them to forecast Gold and Oil prices. The techniques it seems to employ include:

Granger's Causality Test: This statistical hypothesis test is used to determine whether one time series can predict another time series.

Vector Auto Regressive (VAR) Model: This model captures the linear interdependencies among multiple time series.

Data Visualization: The notebook uses libraries such as matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization, which is crucial for understanding time series data.

Data Sources: The notebook seems to utilize external data sources for Gold prices, Silver prices, Crude Oil prices, Stock indices, Interest Rates, and USD rates.

### Conclusion
The notebook is designed to explore and forecast the pricing of commodities such as Gold and Oil using time series analysis. By employing techniques such as Granger's Causality Test and the VAR model, the author aims to analyze the relationships between different economic variables. This type of analysis is valuable for making informed predictions and understanding the factors that influence commodity prices. While the code snippets and markdown cells provided give an initial insight into the notebook's objectives, a more detailed analysis could provide further insights into the methods, results, and potential improvements.​​
